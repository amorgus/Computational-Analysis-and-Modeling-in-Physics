GENERAL FEEDBACK:
Your reports stuck out among the rest because you highlighted (in bold) the key results within the discussion text. 
It improved the presentation and made the report more impactful. 

I'd like to commend your very organized GitHub repo and neat reports. 

In the reflection, don't be shy to share your struggles and what went wrong because these are valuable insights too.
Since the .ipnyb files are very large, you can actually save them as a .tex file 
and compile it in latex for you to have a PDF version. 
In that way, you just visit your GitHub to revisit a code in the future with ease. 

Good job overall, and good luck, Hans!
